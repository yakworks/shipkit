Motivation to rewrite a simple alternative to doctoc: How Much Do You Trust That Package? Understanding The Software Supply Chain https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnELtqE6mMM
Attribution: this include includes prework [done by meleu](https://gist.github.com/meleu/57867f4a01ede1bd730f14b2f018ae89) and I developed the way doctoc interacts with markdown files
Generates a Table of Contents getting a markdown file as first input.
second input is optional and allows you to select minlevel
Inspiration for this script:

The list of invalid chars is probably incomplete, but is good enough for my
current needs.
Got the list from:
